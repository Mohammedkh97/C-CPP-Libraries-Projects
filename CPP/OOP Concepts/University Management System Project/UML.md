To generate a UML diagram directly from code, you can use a variety of tools that parse the code and create UML diagrams automatically. Below are some methods and tools you can use to generate UML diagrams from your C++ code:

### 1. **Using Doxygen with Graphviz**

**Doxygen** is a popular tool for generating documentation from annotated C++ code. It can also generate UML diagrams when combined with **Graphviz**, which provides graph visualization. Here's how you can use them:

#### Steps:
1. **Install Doxygen**: 
   - Download and install Doxygen from [https://www.doxygen.nl/](https://www.doxygen.nl/).
   
2. **Install Graphviz**: 
   - Download and install Graphviz from [https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/).

3. **Create a Doxygen Configuration File**:
   - Run `doxygen -g` in your terminal to generate a default `Doxyfile`.

4. **Edit the Doxyfile**:
   - Open the `Doxyfile` in a text editor and enable UML diagram generation by setting the following options:
   
     ```
     HAVE_DOT = YES           # Enable Graphviz to generate UML diagrams
     EXTRACT_ALL = YES        # Extract all documentation
     ```

   - You can also specify the output format (e.g., HTML or LaTeX):
   
     ```
     OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = docs  # Where the documentation will be saved
     GENERATE_LATEX = YES     # Optionally generate LaTeX for PDF output
     GENERATE_HTML = YES      # Generate HTML files
     ```

5. **Generate Documentation**:
   - Run the command `doxygen Doxyfile` to generate the documentation.
   - Doxygen will parse your code and generate UML diagrams for the classes and their relationships.
   - The UML diagrams will be included in the generated HTML documentation under the `docs/` directory.

#### Example Command:
```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
```

This will generate an HTML folder containing the documentation, including UML class diagrams.

1. **Install PlantUML**:
   - You can install PlantUML via various methods (standalone jar, integration with IDEs, etc.).
   - Visit [https://plantuml.com/](https://plantuml.com/) for installation instructions.

2. **Generate UML with Annotations**:
   - Annotate your C++ classes with `@startuml` and `@enduml` tags. Write the structure of your UML diagram in PlantUML syntax.

#### Example (Manually created PlantUML code):
```plantuml
@startuml
class Person {
    - name: string
    - age: int
    - id: int
    + Person(n: string, a: int, id: int)
    + role(): void
}

class Student {
    - GPA: float
    + Student(n: string, a: int, id: int, gpa: float)
    + role(): void
}

Person <|-- Student

@enduml
```

3. **Generate the Diagram**:
   - Use PlantUML to render the diagram from the `.puml` file. You can use a standalone tool or IDE integration to generate it.

#### Command:
```bash
plantumlt diagram.puml
```

This will generate a UML class diagram based on the provided code structure.

### 5. **Using Code::Blocks (with Plugins)**

**Code::Blocks** is a popular IDE for C++ that supports generating UML class diagrams through plugins such as `UML Plugin` or `Code::Blocks UML`.

#### Steps:
1. **Install Code::Blocks** from [https://www.codeblocks.org/](https://www.codeblocks.org/).
2. **Install the UML Plugin**:
   - Go to `Plugins` → `Manage Plugins` → `Install`.
   - Choose `UML Plugin` or similar to install it.
3. **Generate UML**:
   - Right-click on the project and select `Generate UML`.
   - The UML diagram will be displayed in the IDE.

### Here are some methods you can use in **VSCode**:

### 1. **Using PlantUML with VSCode**

One of the most popular methods for generating UML diagrams in **VSCode** is by using **PlantUML**. It allows you to write UML diagrams in a textual format and generate them directly in the editor.

#### Steps:
1. **Install PlantUML Extension**:
   - Open **VSCode** and go to the Extensions view by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
   - Search for **PlantUML** and install the extension called **"PlantUML"** by **jebbs**.
